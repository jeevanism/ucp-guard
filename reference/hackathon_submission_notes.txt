Rules and undrserstanding for the Hasckathon submission

version1

Based on the text you provided, here is a breakdown of the rules, requirements, and strategy to help you get your entry submitted for the Gemini 3 Hackathon.

### 🚨 URGENT: Timeline Alert

**Current Date:** Feb 7, 2026
**Submission Deadline:** **Feb 9, 2026, at 5:00 P.M. Pacific Time.**
*You have approximately 48 hours remaining.* Do not miss this window.

---

### 1. Eligibility Check (Can you enter?)

Before you finish building, ensure you meet these criteria:

* **Location:** You generally cannot enter if you live in **Italy, Quebec (Canada)**, or US-sanctioned countries (Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria, etc.).
* **Age:** You must be the age of majority in your country (20+ in Taiwan).
* **Affiliation:** You cannot be a Google employee, intern, contractor, or GDE.
* **Team:** You can enter as an individual, a team, or an organization. If working as a team, one person must be the designated "Representative."

### 2. The Core Requirement: What to Build

* **The Tech:** You **must** use the **Gemini 3 API**.
* **The State:** It must be a **NEW** application created during the contest period (Dec 17, 2025 – Feb 9, 2026). You cannot submit an old project or a slight modification of existing work.
* **The Category:** There are no restrictions. It can be a game, productivity tool, scientific analyzer, etc., as long as Gemini 3 is central to its function.

### 3. Submission Checklist (What you need to upload)

To submit successfully on Devpost, you must provide the following four items. Missing any of these may disqualify you.

**A. Text Description (~200 words)**

* **Requirement:** Describe your application.
* **Focus:** Specifically detail **how** you integrated Gemini 3. Explain which features (e.g., deep reasoning, multimodal capabilities) were used and why they are central to the app.

**B. Public Project Link**

* **Option 1 (Preferred):** A link to an **AI Studio app**. This allows judges to test it immediately.
* **Option 2:** A URL to a working interactive demo or product website.
* *Note:* This must be public. No logins or paywalls allowed for the judges.

**C. Public Code Repository**

* **Requirement:** A link to your code (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
* **Condition:** This is required *unless* you provided an AI Studio link in step B. Ideally, provide both if possible to show code quality.

**D. Demonstration Video**

* **Length:** **Maximum 3 minutes.** (Judges may stop watching after the 3-minute mark).
* **Platform:** YouTube or Vimeo (must be public).
* **Content:** Show the project actually functioning. Don't just talk about it; show the screen recording of the app in action.
* **Language:** Spoken English or English subtitles are required.

### 4. How to Win (Judging Criteria)

The prize pool is $100,000. Here is how the judges are scoring you:

1. **Technical Execution (40% - Highest Priority):**
* Does the code actually work?
* Is it buggy?
* **Tip:** Ensure your error handling is solid. Based on the "Inspiration" text provided, they value "Reasoning" and "Self-Healing" code. If your app can fix its own errors using Gemini, that scores high here.


2. **Innovation / "Wow" Factor (30%):**
* Is this unique?
* **Tip:** Avoid simple "chat wrappers." The text emphasizes "Agentic" workflows—apps that *do* things, not just talk.


3. **Potential Impact (20%):**
* Does this solve a real problem for a broad market?


4. **Presentation (10%):**
* Is the video clear? Is the documentation good?



### 5. Next Steps for You

1. **Record your video immediately.** Since you are close to the deadline, do not leave this for the last hour.
2. **Double-check permissions.** Make sure your GitHub repo and YouTube video are set to **Public**, not Private.
3. **Submit.** Go to `Gemini3.devpost.com` and fill out the form before Feb 9th, 5:00 PM PT.

**Would you like me to help you draft the ~200-word text description for your submission if you tell me what your app does?**



version2
Below is a **clean, compressed reading of the rules**, organised by what actually constrains your submission. No interpretation beyond what is written.

---

## 1. What you are allowed to submit

**Mandatory**

* A **new application** created **during the contest period**.
* Must **use the Gemini 3 API** in a *central* way (not decorative).
* Any category is allowed.

**Explicitly not allowed**

* Extensions, refactors, or continuations of earlier projects.
* Anything previously funded, commissioned, licensed, or supported by Google/Devpost.
* Anything that reuses substantial prior work (yours or others’).

---

## 2. What “new” means in practice

Your project must:

* Be conceived and built **after 17 Dec 2025**.
* Not be derived from an existing codebase, product, or prototype.
* Not be a “v2”, “pilot”, or “internal rewrite”.

Open-source libraries are allowed **only if**:

* You comply with their licences.
* Your contribution is clearly additive and original.

---

## 3. Required submission components (all mandatory)

You must submit **all** of the following:

1. **~200-word text**

   * Focused *only* on:

     * Which Gemini 3 features you used.
     * Why those features are essential to the application.

2. **Public working link**

   * Live demo or AI Studio app.
   * No login.
   * No paywall.
   * Judges must be able to test it freely.

3. **Public code repository**

   * Required unless you use AI Studio.
   * Must reflect what the demo shows.

4. **Demo video**

   * Max **3 minutes** (hard cap).
   * Public (YouTube or Vimeo).
   * In English or with English subtitles.
   * Must show the application actually working.

Failure on any one of these = automatic failure at Stage One.

---

## 4. Judging structure (important for prioritisation)

### Stage One (pass/fail)

You are rejected if:

* Any required element is missing.
* The project does not clearly use Gemini 3.
* The demo does not run or match the description.

### Stage Two (scored)

Weighting:

* **Technical execution – 40%**
* **Innovation / wow factor – 30%**
* **Potential impact – 20%**
* **Presentation – 10%**

This means:

* A technically strong but dull project will lose.
* A flashy idea that barely works will lose.
* The demo matters less than the system design, but still matters.

---

## 5. Eligibility constraints (hard exclusions)

You **cannot** participate if:

* You live in or are ordinarily resident in the listed excluded regions (Italy, Quebec, Russia, etc.).
* You are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction.
* You are employed by Google, Devpost, or directly involved contest entities.
* Your participation creates a conflict of interest (Google decides this).

If submitting via an employer:

* You must have explicit permission.
* Any prize is legally yours/employer’s responsibility.

---

## 6. Intellectual property (key points only)

* **You keep ownership** of your project.
* You grant Google a **perpetual, royalty-free licence** to:

  * Evaluate it.
  * Promote it (screenshots, clips, demos).

You **must** guarantee:

* You own all rights to the work.
* No IP infringement.
* No unauthorised third-party data or branding.

---

## 7. Timeline (non-negotiable)

* **Submission deadline:**
  9 Feb 2026, 5:00 PM Pacific Time
* **Judging:**
  10–27 Feb 2026
* **Winners announced:**
  ~4 Mar 2026

No edits allowed after submission closes, except if Google explicitly asks you to remove infringing material.

---

## 8. Practical failure modes to avoid

Automatic disqualification commonly comes from:

* Reusing an old project.
* Demo video longer than 3 minutes.
* “Uses Gemini” without showing *why* Gemini is essential.
* Private demo links.
* Missing team members on Devpost.
* Inconsistent demo vs code.

---

## 9. Final checklist (literal)

Before submitting, confirm:

* New project, built during contest window.
* Gemini 3 is core, not peripheral.
* Public demo works without credentials.
* Public repo or AI Studio link exists.
* Video ≤ 3 minutes and shows functionality.
* All teammates added on Devpost.

If you want, the next step can be to **stress-test your specific project idea against these rules line-by-line**.
